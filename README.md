# Portfolio-AI-Event-Safety-Simulation
A Python-based simulation to identify overcrowding and potential safety risks at large public events using distance-based analysis and visualization.
# AI Event Safety Simulation
## Overview
This project simulates crowd distribution at a public event and identifies high-risk zones based on crowd density.
## Approach
People are represented as points in a 2D space. If a defined number of individuals are detected within a fixed radius, the area is flagged as a potential safety risk.
## Tech Stack
Python, Matplotlib
## Output
Red points represent potential overcrowding and safety risks.
